Hello Universe
=========

The Hello Universe In this project, I will be solving some of the most common, sometimes rare but fun, and thought provoking interview questions. The primary languages will be C and Java. If I need to use existing datastructures, I will probably be using Java, and for simple problems I will probably be using C. Please feel free to imporve upon my code.
