Hello Universe
=========

The Hello Universe is a project with a collection of fun and thought provoking programming problems. You are welcome to use this project to analyze and grow your core programming skills. This project focuses less on programming structures but more on the problem itself, the right data structures for the problem, the best algorithm to use in terms of time and space complexities. These types of questions are most common in first year programming courses and programming interviews, but solving these problems are necessary skills for a good programmer. The primary languages for this project is C and Java. If I need to use existing data structures, I will probably be using Java, and for simple problems I will probably be using C. Please feel free to improve upon my code.
