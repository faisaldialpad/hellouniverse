## Dynamic Programming
1. Write a dynamic programming algorithm to print the nth fibonacci number.

    * Solutions: https://github.com/rfaisal/hellouniverse/blob/master/Java/src/dynamic_programming/Fibonacci.java
2. Given a sequence, find the Contiguous Sub-sequence, sum of which is greater than that of any other Contiguous Sub-sequences. If the input is `{−15,29,−36,3,−22,11,19,−5}` then the output is `{11,19}`.

3. Given a sequence, find the longest Sub-sequence (not necessarily Contiguous) such that each element is strictly greater than its previous in the sub-sequence. If the input is `{−2,11,−4,13,−3,−5,−1,2}` then the output is `{−4,−3,−1,2}`.

4. There is a knapsack of capacity `C` and there are there are `n` items with weights `w1,w2,...,wn` and values `v1,v2,...,vn`. Assume `C,w1,w2,...,wn` are strictly positive integers and there are infinitely many of each items, i.e., unbounded.  Determine the number of each item to include in the knapsack so that the total weight is less than or equal to the knapsack capacity and the total value is maximized.

5. Given `n` types of coin denominations of values `c1<c2<...<cn` (all integers). Assume `c1=1` , so it is always possible to make change for any amount of money `C`. Give an algorithm which makes change for an amount of money `C` with as few coins as possible.

    * Solutions: https://github.com/rfaisal/hellouniverse/blob/master/Java/src/dynamic_programming/MakingChange.java
6. Given two strings `A` and `B`, we want to transform `A` into `B` with a minimum number of operations of the following types: delete a character from `A` , insert a character into `A` , or change some character in  `A` into a new character. The minimal number of such operations required to transform  `A` into  `B` is called the edit distance between  `A` and `B`.

7. Calculate the longest common sub-sequence between 2 strings. Recall, `ac` is a common sub-sequence between `abc` and `acq`. 
    * Link: 
    * Solutions: https://github.com/rfaisal/hellouniverse/blob/master/Java/src/dynamic_programming/LongestCommonSubSeq.java
8. Calculate the longest Palindromic sub-sequence of a string, i.e., the longest sub-sequence that is a palindrome. 
    * Link: 
    * Solutions: https://github.com/rfaisal/hellouniverse/blob/master/Java/src/dynamic_programming/LongestPalindromicSubSeq.java
9. Calculate the longest common substring between 2 strings.

    * Solutions: https://github.com/rfaisal/hellouniverse/blob/master/Java/src/dynamic_programming/LongestCommonSubstring.java
