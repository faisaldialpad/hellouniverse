I am missing something simple and fundamental. Maybe you guys can help.

With an "old-style" array, I can initialize it like this:
int[] myArray = new int[]{ 2000, 100, 40, 60};

With an ArrayList, it seems like I have to do
ArrayList<Integer> myArray = new ArrayList<Integer>();
myArray.add(2000)
myArray.add(100)
myArray.add(40)
myArray.add(60)
for each element that I want to add. Is there a way that I can add any number of integers to my ArrayList in a single line of code?

Any ideas?
